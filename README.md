# 🛠️ Wankel Engine CAD Model

This repository contains a complete 3D CAD model of a Wankel rotary engine designed using SolidWorks. All individual parts, sub-assemblies, and the final assembly are included along with the 2D drawing.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `.SLDPRT` — Individual part files (rotor, shaft, spark plug parts, blockplates, etc.)
- `.SLDASM` — Assembly files (including final and intermediate assemblies)
- `.SLDDRW` — 2D technical drawing of the complete assembly

## 🧩 Key Components

- Eccentric Shaft  
- Front & Centre Blockplates  
- Spark Plug Assembly (Connector, Electrode, Insulator, Nuts)  
- Rotor and Housing  
- Gaskets & Hex Fasteners  
- Extra supporting components

## 🧰 Software Used

- **SolidWorks** 

## 📦 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `Wankel Engine.SLDASM` in SolidWorks.
3. Make sure all part files are in the same directory or correctly referenced.
4. View or edit the 2D drawing via `Wankel Engine.SLDDRW`.
